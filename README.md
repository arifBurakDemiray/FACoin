# Building Software Systems Course Final Project

FACoin is a basic cryptocurrency exchange app. We make request to an coin API for
updated coin values. System has specified trading pairs but any pair can be added
to system easily just adding to coins.json and banknotes.json files and enumarations
of that currencies. 
We also make a request to that API for candles of selected trading pair when user wants
to see its candles. System has hour candles and day candles. History of candles can be changed
in AppSettings. 

We have used concepts of:
* [MVC Design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller)
* [Abstract Factory Design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern)
* [Mediator Design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern)
* [Decorator Design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern)
* [GoF patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)

The main patterns used in this project are MVC, Abstract Factory, Mediator and Decorator patterns
but we used concepts of GoF patterns like State, Adapter, Façade, Factory Method and others.
